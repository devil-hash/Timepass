    <p id="about">Nithyashree, the young music champ was born in Chennai in the year 1999. Her parents are Mr. S. Venkataramanan and 
        Mrs. Lakshmi. Nithya did her schooling at S.B.O.A School in Anna Nagar. Nithyashree’s 
        elder sister, Vhaijaiyanthi Shree was learning the Carnatic music and hence Nithya learnt a lot by listening to her sister’s singing.
        When Nithyashree turned five, she began to sing in her father’s band. She pursued her Carnatic lessons at the age of 6 from 
        Mrs. Lakshmi Raman. Later, she learnt music from Mrs. Lalgudi Padmavathy Ananthagopalan and Mr. T. S. Venkatraman.</p>
